# Hi there, I'm TheKingJoker18! 👋👑

### Computer Science Student | Software & Web Developer | IT University Andoharanofotsy

I'm Ny Hoavisoa Misandratra RANAIVOSON, currently a third-year Computer Science student at IT University Andoharanofotsy in Madagascar[cite: 1]. Driven by natural curiosity about how things work, I'm passionate about finding solutions to daily problems, especially within the IT field[cite: 1]. My adaptability to diverse projects stems from this curiosity, and I believe teamwork is essential for ambitious endeavors[cite: 2, 4]. I'm constantly eager to acquire and apply new skills to improve people's lives, particularly in my home country[cite: 5].

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning/Exploring:

As a student, I'm always deepening my understanding of software and web development. I'm especially focused on understanding how frameworks function, inspired by my current study project: the development of a handmade Java framework[cite: 6]. This project aims to create a user-friendly, well-documented framework, much like Spring Boot[cite: 6].

### ✨ A Little About My Passions Beyond Code:

My interests extend beyond the screen! I believe an accomplished person should care for both body and mind[cite: 8]. When I'm not immersed in development, you can find me:
* Playing the piano 🎹 and singing 🎤
* Hitting the basketball court 🏀
* Diving into a good book 📚 or an insightful documentary 🎬
* Always discovering new things and expanding my horizons!

My passion for problem-solving extends to real-world applications; I believe understanding and solving problems is crucial to truly help people through digital solutions[cite: 9, 12]. I also value continuous learning and staying informed[cite: 13].
